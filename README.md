=START=

You are in a middle of a field.
You don't know who you are, or how you got here. Your memeory is blank. Completly blank.
You look around and see three things.

On your left is a big block of water. It's just a giant rectangle of blue water hovering. It goes from the middle of the sky to the ground. What is holding it up?

On your right is a giant biulding. It is cracked and the front door is missing. So are several of the windows. Or so you think. You can't really see. 
You realize you are nearsighted. Where are your glasses?

Behind you is a field of wheat. You feel something calling you toward there.

Look around-> Main Area

=Main Area=
This place makes you nervous.


Go to the floating water block-> waterblock
Go to the abandoned building -> building
Go to the mysterious field -> field

=WATERBLOCK=

You approach the water block and look around. You put your hand in the water. It envelops it and starts to grow along your arm like slime. You get nervous and pull it out.
Rubbing your arm, you back away. Your heart is beating fast, but not too fast. You notice something glittering. Might it be your glasses?

Go look at the object -> WATERBLOCK2
Leave this place -> MAin Area

=WATERBLOCK2=

You go investigate and find a plastic card. On one side, it has a picture of who must be you and a girl in a red plaid shirt. She is a fake brunnet, and the ends of her hair are pink.
You look on the back on the picture. It is a barcode and looks like one that would get you into a building. That must've been what was glittering.
After looking around for yet a few more minutes, you decide to head back.

Go back-> Sound

=Sound=

On your way back to the field, you hear a scream of laughter. It sounds like a witch in October. It makes you shiver. What was that thing?

Continue on your way to the field-> Main Area
Stand around for a few seconds to clear your mi- wait, what was that?!You should probably investigate!!->Crow

=Crow=
You see something out of the corner of your eye. It's a... crow?
You watch it mesmorized. It soars through the air like a fast black dot. It lands on the arm of a figure on a horse. They are near some trees you never noticed before
You squint and try to see them but you can't. The rider and horse gallop off into the trees.

Follow them?-> Running
No thanks, I'd rather not die.-> Main Area

=Running=

You lumber after them like an oaf. You reach the trees. You are running as fast as you can, but it's not fast enough. You could run faster, but it won't be safe.

Run faster->Running fast

=Running fast=
You run faster, throwing all caution to the wind. You aren't looking and you aren't likely to make it through safe, though you knew that when you started running faster. 
The leaves slap your face, and the brush cuts your legs. It burns and stings sooo bad. You are getting closer, though.

Keep going, don't give up-> Knight

=Knight=

Yes, yes! You are getting closer. The horse is within a few feet now! You see the figure now. It is a knight. Or at least a makeshift one.
They look like they are preparing for a zombie apocalypse. You keep running and notice that you are so close.

Run!!-> Trip

=Trip=

You keep running. Yes, so close. You can see-

YIKES!!
You tripped!!

owweee-> Skewered

=Skewered=

You don't know what direction you are facing. Your mind is still spinning from the fall and you feel a dull pain in your middle.
As you get your bearings, you notice that the pain is sharp and searing. It is unbearable.
You try to move and you mind seems to split with pain. You regain your senses and notice you have been skewered on a stray tree branch. The rider is long gone.

Assess your self-> Assessment
Whimper in pain and waste precoius time that could be used saving your life.-> Whimper

=Whimper=
You whimpered until you died. Good job pal.

Try again, maybe don't die??-> START

=Assessment=

You decide to solve it by launching yourself off like ripping off a bandaid.

Let's get to it then. -> Launching

=Launching=
You put either foot on the side of the branch and count to three. Your nevous, but it's only like a bandaid...right?
You launch youself.

"OOOWWWWWWWWW" you yell as you un-spear yourself from the branch, or rather, Nature's natural daggerâ„¢.
you land with an "oof", look like an oaf, and notice that the trees are shaking. Birds are calling, crawing and flying away with *EARNEST* speed. Great job. Yay.
You laugh loudly, awkwardly and robotacially as you try not to scream. You don't want to attract somebody bad, like that rider. At least you think they are bad. Maybe.
Is that really your biggest concern right now?

Yes.-> Toodle-loo
No.-> Random1

=Toodle-loo=
Well toodle-loo for you.

What's next?-> Random1

=Random1=
You get up with a lot of pain
